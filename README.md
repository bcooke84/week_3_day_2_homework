Lab
You are going to make a table for tracking bounties for Space Cowboys.

An entry in the bounty table must have a selection of at least 4 of these properties:

name
species
bounty value
danger level (low, medium, high, ermagerdyerderd)
last known location
homeworld
favourite weapon
cashed_in
collected_by
Getting Started Checklist
Set up your directory structure
Create console.rb which will be used to create some new objects and practice your methods as required (use this as you are writing the class & methods to test them)
Create a Ruby file for your Bounty class
Write your class definition in the file - initialize, attr_readers, instance variables
Make the database - createdb in command line
Make a .sql file and write some SQL to create your database table
Run the .sql file to set up the table (psql -d data_base_name -f file_name.sql)
Implement save, all, update, delete_all and delete methods on your class
Implement a find_by_name method that returns one instance of your class when a name is passed in, or nil if no instance is found. Note: this will probably be another class method self.find_by_name(name) (do you have to use a map method if it's a single result?)
Implement a second self.find method that returns one instance of your class when an id is passed in.
